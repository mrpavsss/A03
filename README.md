#Part 1:
Github is a website/platform that developers can use to upload their code online. It helps give the public knowledge of
advancing projects as well as possibly taking incite from other developers.
It is useful to have when applying to jobs. It becomes a reference point of all work completed and projects in progress.

Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle
small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple
developers to work together on non-linear development.

WebStorm is an integrated development environment for JavaScript and related technologies. Like other JetBrains IDEs,
it makes your development experience more enjoyable, automating routine work and helping you handle complex tasks with
ease. It is useful in publishing work onto Github.

**Branch** - simply a lightweight movable pointer to a commits.

**Clone** - command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, 
or copy of the target repository.

**Commit** - an operation which sends the latest changes of the source code to the repository, making these changes 
part of the head revision of the repository.

**Fetch** - command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo.

**GIT** - software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers 
collaboratively developing source code during software development

**Github** - a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git

**Merge** - Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the 
independent lines of development

**Merge Conflict** - an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve 
differences in code between two commits

**Push** -  upload local repository content to a remote repository.

**Pull** -  fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local
